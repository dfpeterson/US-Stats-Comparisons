[x] - Subtraction logic  
    [x] - Test interval
[x] - Addition logic  
    [x] - Test logic  
[x] - See if I can convert the dates to datetime objects and make a getter with YYYY-MM-DD (is there a dateimte limit?)  
[x] - US and World GDP  
    [x] - Add to deltas

[ ] - Graphing integrations  
[ ] - Add attributions  
[ ] - Documentation  
[ ] - Lint code  
[ ] - Clean up cleaning scripts and move them to here

# US Stats Comparisons  

Some code to quickly compare a set of stats for the US (and world) to another date (presumably recent)
To Do:  
[x] - Generate Stats for a date  
[x] - Generate comparison to most recent data (negation)  
[x] - Subtraction logic  
    [x] - Test interval
[x] - Addition logic  
    [x] - Test logic
[x] - See if I can convert the dates to datetime objects and make a getter with YYYY-MM-DD (is there a dateimte limit?)  
[ ] - Graphing integrations  
[ ] - Add attributions  
[ ] - Documentation  
[ ] - Clean up cleaning scripts and move them to here  
[ ] - Try polars

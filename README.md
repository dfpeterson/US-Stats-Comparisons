# US Stats Comparisons  

Some code to quickly compare a set of stats for the US (and world) to another date (presumably recent)
To Do:  
[x] - Generate Stats for a date  
[x] - Generate comparison to most recent data (negation)  
[x] - Subtraction logic  
    [x] - Test interval
[x] - Addition logic  
    [x] - Test logic  
[x] - See if I can convert the dates to datetime objects and make a getter with YYYY-MM-DD (is there a dateimte limit?)  
[x] - US and World GDP  
    [x] - Add to deltas  
[ ] - US Flags  
    [x] - Add images  
    [x] - Add to state admissions as a 1st pass  
    [x] - Create a flags file (since flags are synched to 4th of July)  
    [x] - Create a flag class  
    [ ] - See if there is a realistic image alternative  
[x] - US Presidents  
    [x] - Resize portraits
    [x] - Generate inaugurations csv
    [x] - Add class to us_stats
[ ] - Historical events

    [ ] - Major inventions  
    [ ] - Wars  
        [ ] - The Civil War period  
    [ ] - Tallest building  
    [ ] - Slavery indicator  
[ ] - Refactor code into multiple files  
    [ ] - Split into files
    [ ] - Create generic population/delta class
    [ ] - Create generic GDP/delta class
    [ ] - Regenerate data for generic classes
[ ] - Graphing integrations  
[ ] - Add attributions  
[ ] - Documentation  
[ ] - Lint code  
[ ] - Clean up cleaning scripts and move them to here  
    [ ] - Pull from web sources  
    [ ] - Backfill from 1600  (find sources for up to 1800)
[ ] - Try polars or duckdb
